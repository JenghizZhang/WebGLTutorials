### Useful resources:
If you need a refresher on HTML and JavaScript visit [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com) that can also serve as a wonderful reference manual for JavaScript and HTML.
Step by step tutorials on our first sessions can be found at [tutorials section of abubujs.org](https://www.abubujs.org/learning/tutorials/?help=doc). While the documentation of the library is still lacking, the tutorial section is a great starting point.
