# WebGL Tutorials
_Special Course at GaTech (CSE-8903-C18)_

## General Info
### Where to participate?
We have regular classes on BlueJeans on Wednesday and Fridays from 3:15 pm to 4:15 pm EST. 

If you are interested to participate in the class or you are looking for a collaborative project email us at [abouzar.kaboudian@physics.gatech.edu](mailto:abouzar.kaboudian@physics.gatech.edu), [flavio.fenton@physics.gatech.edu](mailto:flavio.fenton@physics.gatech.edu), or [echerry30@gatech.edu](mailto:echerry30@gatech.edu).

The files and video recordings of the lectures will be regularly posted here.


### Useful resources:
* If you need a refresher on HTML and JavaScript visit [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com) that can also serve as a wonderful reference manual for JavaScript and HTML.
* Step by step tutorials on our first sessions can be found at [tutorials section of abubujs.org](https://www.abubujs.org/learning/tutorials/?help=doc). While the documentation of the library is still lacking, the tutorial section is a great starting point.

* [A quick reference guide for the GLSL language can be found here](https://www.khronos.org/files/webgl20-reference-guide.pdf).

### Prerequisites:
- Basic familiarity with computer coding preferably HTML, JavaScript and C programming
- Having access to a text editor suitable for modifying computer code (Atom, Sublime, Notepad++, WinEdit, Bracket, VIM, EMACS)
- Having access to a modern browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or similar (not Internet Explorer or Safari!)
