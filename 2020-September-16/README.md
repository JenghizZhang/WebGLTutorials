## Objectives
1. Preparing tabulated data on CPU ;
1. Using tabulated data in shaders ;
1. Solving a reaction-diffusion model with more than 4 state variables ;
1. A preview on how to setup a WebGL program using multiple source files with a server side solution (PHP) ;

You can download the necessary files for [September 16 session from here](./2020-September-16)

[The Beeler-Reuter model can be found from this link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283659/pdf/jphysiol00808-0190.pdf). 

The directory [php](./php) is the multi-file setup of the Beeler-Reuter program that was used during the class. In order to open this project, the files need to run from a server. Alternatively, one can install a php interpreter and run the Makefile in the terminal to generate the resulting HTML file.

The [cheat-sheets](./cheat-sheets) directory includes the HTML output of the program for those who are more comfortable working with a single file.
