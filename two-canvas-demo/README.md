# A Two-Canvas Demo

In this example, we have set up two canvases to show the `u` and `v` fields of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. 

Clicking on the `canvas_1` alters the `u` field and the `canvas_2` changes the `v` field. 

The program is available in multi-file php version and the single executable file. 

For the single HTML file  version see [fhn.html](fhn.html) which is generated using the Makefile.
